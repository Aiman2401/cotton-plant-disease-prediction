This project is a deep learning–based web application for detecting cotton plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Users can upload an image of a cotton leaf, and the model predicts whether the leaf is healthy or diseased, helping in early disease identification and crop monitoring.
Project Overview:
The system uses a trained CNN model built with PyTorch, integrated into a Flask web application.
It allows users to interact with the model through a simple web interface where they can upload images and receive predictions in real time.
